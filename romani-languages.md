The Romani languages
====================

Classifying Romani languages for language technology purposes is complicated. There are more Romani languages than there are ISO codes and some ISO codes thus cover several varieties (marked with parenthesis below). The table below gives language names, ISO and Glottolog codes, as well as indicated whether the language is standardised by the authorities in Finland (F), Sweden (S) or Norway (N).

Starting 2017, the Swedish Language Council has initiated a project aiming at revising the orthographies of Romani languages in Swedan, cf. [this orientation](https://www.isof.se/lar-dig-mer/kunskapsbanker/lar-dig-mer-om-nationella-minoritetssprak/romska/det-romska-spraket). At present, all languages marked **S** in the table above have their own distinct orthographies, but one possible outcome of the Swedish project  is thus that several of them may be unified.
